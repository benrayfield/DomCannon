Imagine 3d worlds with webpage parts in them.
This tiny javascript/html software lets you drive a car in 3d in browser
but has potential to do alot more once its generalized to N divs on N rectangle polygons.
Inside those divs could be javascript code editors to add more CannonJS game objects,
like stacking blocks to drive into them to knock them down,
or load videos or websites in iframes on polygons. Drag and drop. etc. (TODO).

Early experiment in making a 3d webpage. Puts a html div on the top polygon of a CannonJS RigidVehicle,
and 2 input type=range / sliders in it, one for gas and one for steering.
Also uses browser gamepad API so left joystick does gas and steering.
